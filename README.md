# flutter_micro_app
- Created a basic counter app to understand the micro app concept
- Used `flutter_micro_app` package.
- Used ValueNotifiers for state persistence.
- A quick App overview:
    - Host app has two buttons
        1. Go to Counter app - This will take you to Counter MicroApp
        2. Reset Increment Value - This opens Theme MicroApp in a float window and we can reset the increment value from here
    - Host App Also shows a widget of Theme MicroApp as a part of itself.
    - From the Theme MicroApp we can also control the color of a container in the Host App.
